# Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis through Cardiac Image Segmentation

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper titled "Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis through Cardiac Image Segmentation" accepted for ISBI 2024 – International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging.

## Abstract

Automated diagnosis of cardiovascular disease relies on cardiac image segmentation, a critical task in medical imaging. Our proposed strategy employs specialist networks focusing on individual anatomies (left ventricle, right ventricle, or myocardium) to achieve accurate segmentation. In the initial stage, a ternary segmentation is performed to identify these anatomical regions, followed by cropping the original image for focused processing. An attention mechanism, facilitated by an additive attention block (E-2A block), interlinks features from different anatomies, serving as a soft relative shape prior. Our approach aims for efficiency and effectiveness in cardiac image segmentation.
